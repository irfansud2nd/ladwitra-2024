# La Dwitra 2024 - Registration Website

## Introduction

La Dwitra is an annual event orginized by [SMA Labschool UPI Cibiru](https://smalabsupicibiru.sch.id/) and supported by event organizer owned by my close friend. Therefore, I have the opportunity to facilitate registrations for silat championsip and jaipong competition through the website that I have developed.

This website is also my third paid and commercial project. I think this website is way more better than my last 2 similiar projects, i learned a lot of new things in the depelopment process. It was created in about two week, but I still maintain this website until the event is over.
